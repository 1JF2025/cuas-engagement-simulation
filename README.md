# C-UAS Engagement Simulation — Drone / Jammer / Interceptor

## Overview
An interactive simulation that demonstrates how opposing systems (Drones, Jammers, and Interceptors) counter one another using simple game logic.

- **Drone** — Unmanned aircraft for surveillance or strike
- **Jammer** — Disrupts communication or navigation signals
- **Interceptor** — Physically disables or removes threats

## Game Rules
- **Drone defeats Interceptor** — mobility and stealth advantage
- **Jammer defeats Drone** — electronic denial
- **Interceptor defeats Jammer** — kinetic suppression or physical removal

## Implementation
- **Built With:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Core Logic:** Deterministic engagement rules, random adversary choice, and match scoring
- **UI:** Command buttons, live scoreboard, engagement result panel
- **Code Structure:** Clear separation between game logic and UI for readability and maintainability
